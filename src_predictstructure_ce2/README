This program is a part of the spin-atom CE package for the layered LNC system.
This program construct the correlation matrix from the configuration of atomic species and magnetic moment.
To compile this program, type the following at the prompt.

>> make

It will build an executable, run_findcluster_ce.

To run the executable, the parameters in the following list should be provided.

1) howmanyCo: the number of Co atoms, to 
2) newstart: 1-new start (random initial configurations), 0-restart (load existing initial configurations)
3) max_iter: the maximum number of iteration
4) kT: the thermal energy in Boltzmann factor
5) dispfreq: the frequency of displaying and storing the result
6) np: the number of cationic lattice sites
7) neighbor_num: the number of neighbors of each atom
8) howmanyclustercol: the number of cluster functions (selected from find cluster)
9) ncluster1: the number of point cluster types
10) ncluster2: the number of pair cluster types
11) ncluster3: the number of three-body cluster types
12) data_ini_filename: the file name of initial configuration of atomic species
13) magmom_ini_filename: the file name of initial configuration of spin species

These parameters should be written in param.dat.

In addition to param.dat, the following files also should be provided.
1) cluster_set_min.dat: the selected cluster functions
2) x.dat: the corresponding effective cluster interactions
3) nlist.dat: neighbor list
4) map_to_cluster1.dat: mapping info, from a lattice site to point cluster type
5) map_to_cluster2.dat: mapping info, from a pair of lattice sites to pair cluster type
6) map_to_cluster3.dat: mapping info, from a set of three lattice sites to three-body cluster type
7) *.dat, for atomic species: initial configuration of atomic species at each lattice site
8) *.dat, for spin types: initial configuration of spin types at each lattice site

The files 1) and 2) can be provided from the results of running findcluster (another program of the package), and the files 3)-6) can be provided from running clusterlist (another program of the package). The files 7) and 8) must be provided if newstart is set to 0 and their names should be specified in param.dat

You can run the executable as follows.

>>./run_findcluster_ce

The results will be stored in dir_result, which will be created or updated during the running, as listed in the following list.

1) data_trial_min.dat: the atomic species at each lattice site of the optimal structure
2) magmom_trial_min.dat: the spin type at each lattice site of the optimal structure
3) on_the_fly_datamag_****.dat: the coupled configuration of atomic species (column 1) and spin type (column 2) at each lattice site of the intermediate structures
4) corr_mat_trial0.dat: the correlation matrix from the initial configurations
